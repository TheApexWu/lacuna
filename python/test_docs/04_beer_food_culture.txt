Food and drink are never merely sustenance -- they are cultural institutions, carriers of identity, and expressions of a society's deepest values. These passages trace the cultural significance of beer, bread, and communal eating from historical legislation to modern food writing.

The Reinheitsgebot (Bavarian Beer Purity Law, 1516), proclaimed by Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria:

"Ganz besonders wollen wir, dass forthin allenthalben in unseren Stadten, Markten und auf dem Lande zu keinem Bier mehr Stucke als allein Gersten, Hopfen und Wasser verwendet und gebraucht werden sollen."

(We especially decree that henceforth in all our cities, markets, and in the countryside, nothing but barley, hops, and water shall be used for the brewing of beer.)

"Wer diese Verordnung wissentlich ubertritt, dem soll von seiner Gerichtsobrigkeit solch Fass Bier ohn alle Nachsicht weggenommen werden."

(Whoever knowingly violates this ordinance shall have each barrel of beer confiscated by the court authorities, without fail.)

On Stammtisch culture, researchers Franz Droge and Gudrun Schwibbe wrote that the tradition likely began in the 17th and 18th centuries, when artists, writers and thinkers across Europe would congregate in various cafes and bars to exchange ideas and discuss their work. Later in the 19th century, it was the subversive politicians and union organisers who would gather around the table and talk over actions and political problems.

In the second half of the 19th century, a Stammtisch typically consisted of local dignitaries such as the mayor, doctor, pharmacist, teacher, forester, or wealthy farmers. Historically, a Stammtisch was an all-male affair that might involve socialising, card playing -- such as Skat or Schafkopf -- and often political or philosophical discussions. The word itself comes from "Stamm" meaning clan or tribe, and "Tisch" meaning table: literally the clan's table, the table for regulars.

On Oktoberfest: The first Oktoberfest was held on October 12, 1810, to celebrate the wedding of Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen. The festivities took place on the fields in front of the city gates, which were subsequently named Theresienwiese (Therese's meadow) in honor of the bride.

For the next eighty years, beer was served only in small wooden huts. Starting in 1895, the large Munich breweries began to erect temporary beer halls for around 1,500 visitors. Munich innkeepers teamed up with breweries to replace huts with massive tents -- nicknamed "beer castles" -- big enough to hold thousands. These new halls featured live brass bands, endless refills, and the festive atmosphere that would come to define Oktoberfest as the world's largest folk festival.

M.F.K. Fisher, "The Art of Eating" (1954) and other writings:

"It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security and love, are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it."

"There is a communion of more than our bodies when bread is broken and wine drunk. And that is my answer, when people ask me: Why do you write about hunger, and not wars or love?"

"Since we must eat to live, we might as well do it with both grace and gusto."

"We ate terrines of pate ten years old under their tight crusts of mildewed fat. We addled our palates with snipes hung so long they fell from their hooks, and quenched our half-shocked thirst in cobwebby Burgundies."
