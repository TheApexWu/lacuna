Wilson's Fourteen Points and the Promise of Self-Determination

President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points outlined a vision for a new world order based on open diplomacy, free trade, and national self-determination. The principle of Selbstbestimmung (self-determination) promised that peoples would choose their own governments.

Yet the application was inconsistent. While new nations emerged in Europe, colonial peoples were denied the same right. The Mandate system placed former German and Ottoman territories under Allied "tutelage" - a civilizing mission that preserved imperial control.

Wilson spoke of "peace without victory" - a magnanimous settlement that would not humiliate the defeated. But French demands for sécurité and revanche overrode American idealism. Clemenceau insisted on guarantees against future German aggression.

The League of Nations represented Wilson's hope for collective security and international cooperation. Germany was initially excluded - treated as a pariah rather than integrated into the new order. This exclusion fed German resentment and undermined the legitimacy of the Versailles settlement.
