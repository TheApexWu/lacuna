Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (The War Guilt Clause)

The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.

This became known as the Kriegsschuldparagraph in Germany - the war guilt clause that placed sole moral and legal responsibility on Germany. The German delegation at Versailles protested vehemently, calling it a Schmach - a national disgrace that violated their sense of Ehre (honor).

The clause served as the legal foundation for the Reparationen (reparations) that would cripple the German economy. Many Germans saw this as Versklavung - economic enslavement disguised as justice. The concept of Wiedergutmachung (making amends) was twisted into punishment.

The Dolchstoßlegende emerged as a counter-narrative: Germany had not lost the war militarily but had been betrayed by politicians who signed an unjust peace. This myth of the "stab in the back" would poison Weimar democracy.
