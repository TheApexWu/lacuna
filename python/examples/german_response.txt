The German Response to Versailles

Count Brockdorff-Rantzau, head of the German delegation, refused to stand when receiving the treaty terms - a deliberate act of defiance. Germany had expected negotiations based on the Fourteen Points; instead they received a Diktat - a dictated peace with no discussion.

The terms were devastating: loss of territory including Alsace-Lorraine, the Polish Corridor, and all colonies; military limitations to 100,000 troops; occupation of the Rhineland; massive reparations of undefined amount.

The Nationalversammlung in Weimar debated whether to sign. Rejection meant Allied invasion; acceptance meant national humiliation. Chancellor Scheidemann declared: "What hand would not wither that binds itself and us in these fetters?"

The treaty was signed on June 28, 1919 - exactly five years after Sarajevo. For Germans, it was a Schandfrieden (shameful peace). The seeds of Revanchismus were planted: the determination to revise the treaty and restore German honor. The Weimar Republic would never escape the stigma of those who had signed.

The concepts of Schuld (guilt) and Sühne (atonement) became central to German political discourse. Some accepted responsibility; others rejected it entirely. The treaty's harshness, many argued, proved Allied hypocrisy about justice and self-determination.
